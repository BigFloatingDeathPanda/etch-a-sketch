Etch-a-Sketch Work in Progress

TODO: Figure out how to mouse-over and select any element by doing so.

TODO: Reset Button, pick 5.  Notice the border still goes across the page?  Yeah, figure that one out.

TODO: Center the grid on the page so no matter what size it's always in the middle, and the top is always just below the heading.
