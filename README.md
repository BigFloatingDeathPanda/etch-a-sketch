Etch-a-Sketch Work in Progress

TODO (Probably need to know more): Make Auto / Click buttons function correctly.

THOUGHTS:

I didn't have too much trouble implementing the creation of the grid, those sizing and positioning it in CSS presented some challenges.  CSS in general continues to present some challenges.

I feel more confident in my DOM manipulation after this project.

Implementing "lighten" and "darken" was a challenge!  I'm sure my code is not efficient, but it gets the job done.
