Etch-a-Sketch Work in Progress

(DONE) TODO: Figure out how to mouse-over and select any element by doing so.

Follow Up ToDo: Figure out why it only works on page load.  Should work for any size grid put in.  Probably need to call a function or something.

TODO: Reset Button, pick 5.  Notice the border still goes across the page?  Yeah, figure that one out.

(DONE) TODO: Center the grid on the page so no matter what size it's always in the middle, and the top is always just below the heading.

(DONE) TODO: Remove "row/column names from each row and column.  Those were just placeholders to make sure you were generating the grid correctly, and correctly identifying rows vs columns in your loops"
