Etch-a-Sketch Work in Progress

TODO: Make Auto / Click buttons function correctly.  I can change the code directly to have it be all-auto or all-click, but I can't seem to get the toggle switch down just yet.

THOUGHTS:

I didn't have too much trouble implementing the creation of the grid, those sizing and positioning it in CSS presented some challenges.  CSS in general continues to present some challenges.

I feel more confident in my DOM manipulation after this project.

Implementing "lighten" and "darken" was a challenge!  I'm sure my code is not efficient, but it gets the job done.

Something Significant that I learned: You can (accidentally) add the same .addEventListener multiple times.  If that event happens once, it'll happen once for every time the event listener was added.  It took a bit to debug that, but I finally got it.
