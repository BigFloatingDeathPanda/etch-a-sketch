Etch-a-Sketch Work in Progress

Final Etch-a-Sketch until I know more.

TODO (Could probably be done now): Change "Rainbow" name to "Random".  Add actual "Rainbow" feature where hue incements by X for each successive mouse-over.

TODO (Probably need to know more): Make Auto / Click buttons function correctly.

THOUGHTS:

I didn't have too much trouble implementing the creation of the grid, those sizing and positioning it in CSS presented some challenges.  CSS in general continues to present some challenges.

I feel more confident in my DOM manipulation after this project.
